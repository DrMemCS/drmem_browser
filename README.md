# DrMem Browser

A browser to interact with a DrMem node.

## Getting Started

This project was built using VSCode.

NOTE: This is a new project and currently doesn't do much. This README will be updated as new features are added.

- Listens to mDNS annoucements for instances of DrMem and adds them to a ListView which some information obtained from the annoucement. Selecting an instance will take you to another screen which does nothing. To get back, you have to restart the app.
